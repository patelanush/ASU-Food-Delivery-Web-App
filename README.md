# UCLA-Food-Delivery-Web-App

## This food delivery web app scrapes the UCLA dining hall menu using the Beautiful Soup Python library and displays the data in a ReactJS interface, allowing students to easily order food and have it delivered, saving them time.

This web application is a food delivery service that scrapes data from the UCLA dining hall menu using the Beautiful Soup Python library. The app fetches menu data, including menu items and their food categories such as vegan and vegetarian, which are tagged accordingly on the UCLA website. The data is then displayed in an interactive web interface built with React.js, allowing students to view, filter, and order food efficiently. The front end is developed using JavaScript and HTML, and styled with CSS, providing a user-friendly experience. Students can select food items based on categories, add them to a cart, and see the total cost along with delivery charges. The food images displayed represent the dining hall locations from where the food is made, rather than the actual food items. The app features dynamic food sorting by category, allowing students to view and order items efficiently. Additionally, the app includes sign-in and sign-up features for user management.
